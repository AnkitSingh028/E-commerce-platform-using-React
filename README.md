Today, I had the opportunity to attend a session on building an e-commerce platform using React, conducted by Shashwat Bagaria (Ex Senior SDE-1 at JioHotstar).

The session offered valuable practical insights into:

Structuring a scalable React application

Component-based architecture and state management

Real-world considerations when building production-level e-commerce features

It was great learning from someone with strong industry experience and understanding how concepts are applied beyond tutorials.

Grateful for the opportunity and excited to apply these learnings in my own projects 🚀
